## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies Added
```txt
node2vec==0.4.6      # Node2Vec graph embeddings
gensim==4.3.2        # Word2Vec backend for node2vec
umap-learn==0.5.5    # UMAP dimensionality reduction
```

### Architecture Patterns
- **Singleton Pattern**: Service instances cached globally for performance
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback mechanisms when optional packages unavailable
- **Pydantic Models**: Type-safe request/response validation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch with logging
- **Caching**: Path caching in multi-hop reasoner for performance

   - ✅ Embedding training (128-dimensional)
   - ✅ Similarity search working

2. **ComplEx**:

### Sample API Calls
```bash
# Build graph
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/v1/knowledge-graph/node2vec/build \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"edges":[["CHEMBL25","treats","MONDO:0005148"]]}'

# Train embeddings
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/v1/knowledge-graph/node2vec/train \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{}'

# Add temporal fact
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/v1/knowledge-graph/temporal/fact \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"head":"CHEMBL25","relation":"treats","tail":"MONDO:0005148","timestamp":"2025-01-01T00:00:00Z"}'

# Get system metadata
curl http://localhost:8081/v1/knowledge-graph/metadata
```

## Known Issues & Limitations
1. **ComplEx Training**: Requires larger datasets (minimum ~50 triples recommended)
2. **Node2Vec Performance**: Training can be slow on very large graphs (>10K nodes)
3. **Port Conflict**: Development had multiple server instances on port 8080 (resolved by using port 8081)

## Next Steps (Phase 4: Enhanced ML Models)
Based on the 24-month roadmap, Phase 4 will include:
- Transformer-based models for sequence data
- Meta-learning for few-shot drug repurposing
- Ensemble methods combining multiple models
- Active learning for data efficiency
