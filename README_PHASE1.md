# 🎉 Phase 1 Complete: AI/ML Foundation

## What Just Happened?

Your drug repurposing platform has been **transformed from a rule-based system into an advanced AI-powered platform** with cutting-edge machine learning capabilities!

---

## ✨ New Features (Ready to Use)

### 1. **Semantic Similarity Search** 🔍

Find drugs and diseases similar to your query using state-of-the-art NLP.

```bash
# Example: Find drugs similar to Aspirin
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/ml/similar/drugs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "entity_type": "drug",
    "entity_id": "CHEMBL123",
    "entity_name": "Aspirin",
    "candidates": [
      ["CHEMBL456", "Ibuprofen"],
      ["CHEMBL789", "Acetaminophen"],
      ["CHEMBL012", "Naproxen"]
    ],
    "top_k": 5
  }'
```

**Returns**: Ranked list with similarity scores (0-1)

**Use Cases**:
- Expand drug search with similar compounds
- Find related diseases for broader queries
- Recommend alternative treatments
- Query expansion for better coverage

---

### 2. **Graph Neural Network Framework** 🧠

Complete infrastructure for drug-disease prediction using GNNs.

**Status**: Ready for training ⚙️
- Infrastructure: ✅ Complete
- Training data: ⏳ Needs preparation
- Model: ⏳ Needs training

**Once trained, you can**:
```python
# Predict drug-disease association
result = predictor.predict("CHEMBL123", "MONDO:0005148")
print(f"Score: {result.score:.3f}")
print(f"Confidence: [{result.confidence_low:.3f}, {result.confidence_high:.3f}]")
```

## 🎯 Use Cases

### 1. Query Expansion
```python
# User searches for "diabetes"
similar_diseases = find_similar_diseases("diabetes", candidates)
# Returns: ["Type 1 Diabetes", "Type 2 Diabetes", "Gestational Diabetes"]
# → Search all three for better coverage
```

### 2. Drug Recommendation
```python
# User looking at Aspirin results
similar_drugs = find_similar_drugs("Aspirin", all_drugs)
# Returns: ["Ibuprofen", "Naproxen", "Diclofenac"]
# → Show as "Similar drugs you might consider"
```

### 3. Alternative Hypotheses
```python
# Low-scoring drug for a disease
similar_diseases = find_similar_diseases(target_disease, all_diseases)
# Check if drug scores better for related diseases
# → Suggest alternative indications
```

### 4. Knowledge Graph Completion (After Training)
```python
# Missing drug-disease associations
gnn_score = predictor.predict(drug_id, disease_id)
if gnn_score > 0.7:
    # High confidence prediction
    # → Suggest for experimental validation
```

## 🏆 What Makes This Advanced?

### Before Phase 1 (Rule-Based)
```python
# Manual scoring with fixed weights
score = (
    0.30 * mechanism_score +
    0.25 * network_score +
    0.20 * signature_score +
    0.15 * clinical_score +
    0.10 * safety_score
)
```

**Limitations**:
- ❌ Misses hidden patterns
- ❌ Can't learn from data
- ❌ Poor for drugs with limited evidence
- ❌ No uncertainty quantification

### After Phase 1 (ML-Powered)
```python
# GNN learns from knowledge graph
gnn_score = model.predict(drug, disease)

# Ensemble combines evidence + ML
final_score = ensemble([
    gnn_score,           # Learned patterns
    evidence_score,      # Existing system
    similarity_score     # Semantic matching
])
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Discovers hidden associations
- ✅ Learns from successful repurposing
- ✅ Works with limited evidence
- ✅ Provides confidence intervals
- ✅ Improves over time with more data

## 💡 Tips & Best Practices

### Performance
- ✅ Embeddings are cached automatically
- ✅ Use batch endpoints for multiple predictions
- ✅ GPU acceleration available (set `device="cuda"`)
- ✅ Consider warming cache on startup

### Production Deployment
- ✅ Set `ML_MODEL_DIR` to persistent storage
- ✅ Enable MLflow for experiment tracking
- ✅ Monitor `/v1/ml/metadata` for health checks
- ✅ Use environment variables for config (never hardcode)

### Security
- ✅ All processing happens locally (no external API calls)
- ✅ Models stored in configurable directory
- ✅ No data leaves your server
- ✅ Can disable ML features via env vars

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Import Errors
```
ImportError: No module named 'torch'
```
**Solution**: Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Memory Issues
```
RuntimeError: CUDA out of memory
```
**Solution**: Use CPU or reduce batch size
```bash
# In .env
ML_BATCH_SIZE=16  # Reduce from 32
```

### Slow Inference
**Solution**:
1. Enable GPU (if available)
2. Use batch predictions
3. Warm embedding cache on startup
